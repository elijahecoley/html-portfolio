<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  My name is Elijah Coley and I'm currently a Virtual Design and Construction
  Manager for a Construction Tech startup called Dusty Robotics. I live in
  Seattle, WA and work 100% remote for Dusty who is based in Moutain View, CA.
  In my current role, I assist customers with data extraction from Revit and
  AutoCAD and integration into Dusty software and hardware. Dusty has a mobile
  robot that reproduces floor plans at 1:1 scale in ink on the jobsite for
  tradespeople to build from. I've also worked as a Field Engineer teaching
  people how to use the tool and been a customer facing technical asset in both
  pre and post sales. Some might say I've already made my transition out of
  Architecture! I'm still lingering in the Construction world and want to make
  the final leap into a 100% tech-focused role here in Seattle. In the last
  couple of years I've been more interested in programming (I was able to code
  some functionality into our software while we built out an engineering team),
  the product lifecycle, and feature creation and spcification.

<p>
  My next goal is to become more familiar with web development and eventually
  make the jump to a fully development focused role. I've been learning from 
  on the job experience in C# and .Net and from Udemy's Web Development Course.
  I've been gaining web development specific expreience working as an apprentice
  in the Tech Fleet Community. Work from my experience can be found on the
  projects page.
